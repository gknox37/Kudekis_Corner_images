#Reflection/Transmission Coefficients

\\
##Overview 
We define coefficients to decribe the magnitudes of incident transverse E and
M waves.
These coeffiecients are relevent when a plane wave is incident at an
interpahse separating two homogeneos regions where Maxwell's equations hold.
Below is a diagram an incident TEM wave phasors as well as the reflected and
transmitted waves.

##Equations
To derive these coeffcients we apply Maxwell's equations at the boundry
between the two regions.
\\
Looking at the continuous E field and the tangential H field at the interphase
and the impediance of the two regions we can measue the magnitude of the
reflected wave. We

We define the reflection coefficient(uppercase gamma) as the magnitude of the incident wave E field divided by the magnitude of the the reflected E field.
We recieve the following equation:

We define the tranmission coeffcient(lowercase tau) as the magnitude of the
incident wave E field divided by the magnitude of the transmitted E field. We
recieve the following equation:
