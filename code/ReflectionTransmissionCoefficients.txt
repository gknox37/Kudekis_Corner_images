#Reflection/Transmission Coefficients

\\
##Overview 
We define the reflection and transmission coefficients to decribe the
magnitudes of reflected and transmited transverse E and
M waves.
These coeffiecients are relevent when a plane wave is incident at an
interpahse separating two homogeneos regions where Maxwell's equations hold.
Below is a diagram an incident TEM wave phasors as well as reflected and
transmitted waves.

##Equations
To derive these coeffcients we apply Maxwell's equations at the boundry
between the two regions. Each region has its own impedance defined by:
\\ 
Looking at the continuous E field and the tangential H field at the interphase
and the impediance of the two regions we can measue the magnitude of the
reflected wave. We recieve the following equation:

\\
We define the reflection coefficient(uppercase gamma) as the magnitude of the incident wave E field divided by the magnitude of the the reflected E field.
We recieve the following equation:

We define the tranmission coeffcient(lowercase tau) as the magnitude of the
incident wave E field divided by the magnitude of the transmitted E field. We
recieve the following equation:

##Special Cases
###Perfect conductor
When the region the wave is traveling into is a perfect conduction with
conductivity >> 1, we have complete reflectivity.

\\
###Matched impedance
When the region the wave is traveling into has the matched impedance we have
comeplete transmission.

###Lossless
When the conductivity of the second region is 0, and the impedances are not
matched, you will have reflected as well as transmitted waves.
