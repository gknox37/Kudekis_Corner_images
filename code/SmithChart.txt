The smith chart is a graphical tool that allows us to find tranmission line
parameters easily. 
It allows us to plot a complex impedance and then ,\\Impedance in this context is a complex number defined as:

With resistive component R and reactive part X
##Steps 
###1.Normalize by impedance.
To normalize simply divide the impedance by the characteristic impedance of
of the transmission line
###2.Find the resistance and the reactance intersection on the chart.
You now have the resistance and the reactance that you can use of the smith
chart itself. The resistnace value can be located along the the horizontal
real axis. The value is shown in circles that expand outword as you move away
from the point (1,0).
\\
The reactance value can be located on arches that eminate from the point
(1,0). 
Remeber that if the reactance is negative, it is located in the lower half of the smith chart circle.
The point at which the circle described by the resistance meets the arch described by the reatance is your impedance value on the smith chart
###3.Draw Circle 
After ploting your impedance on the smith chart you should now draw VSWR
circle that is centered at the origin, and has a radius that extends from
origin to your plotted impedance.
